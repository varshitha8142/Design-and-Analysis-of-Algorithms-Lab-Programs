**List of Practical Experiments**:

1. Sort a given set of elements using the Quick sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.

2. Implement a parallelized Merge Sort algorithm to sort a given set of elements and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.

3. Use divide and conquer method to recursively implement and to find the maximum and minimum in a given list of n elements.

4. Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graph using
(i) Kruskal's algorithm.     (ii) Primâ€™s algorithm.

5. Consider the following five jobs and their associated weights and deadlines, implement job sequencing algorithm to obtain optimal solution.
        
6. (i) Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph using BFS method.
   (ii) Check whether a given graph is connected or not using DFS method.

7. Find a subset of a given set S = {s1,s2,.....,sn} of n positive integers whose sum is equal to a given positive integer d. For example, if S= {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d = 9 there are two solutions {1,2,6} and {1,8}.A suitable message is to be displayed if the given problem instance doesn't have a solution.

8. Implement All Pairs Shortest Paths Problem using Floyd's algorithm.

9. From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.

10. Implement backtracking method to color all the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color (Graph Coloring Problem).      
Implement any scheme to find the optimal solution for the Traveling Salesperson problem and then solve the same problem instance using any approximation algorithm and determine the error in the approximation.

11. Develop an algorithm to evaluate an algebraic expression.
